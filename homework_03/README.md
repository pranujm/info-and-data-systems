## Overview
This assignment analyzes NHL game play data using R and SQL (via the sqldf package). 
The analysis focuses on shot statistics, missed shots, and goal differences across teams and periods.

## Note
The game_plays_sample.csv file contains only 10000 rows sampled from the original game_plays.csv dataset 
(381.5 MB, not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations).

The complete analysis was performed on the full dataset containing all NHL game play records. 
The sample file is provided for demonstration and code verification purposes.

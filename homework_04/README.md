## Overview
This project demonstrates JSON data manipulation in R, working with a mixed database of historical figures, fictional characters, and food items.

## Note
The rich_famous.json file contains objects of different people, fictional chaarcters, and foods. 
Each object contains key-value pairs of the object's attributes. 
For example, if the object's entity_type is person, they are a real person with the attributes name, web, dob, occupation, and known for.
